# Blender_Housetype_Estimator

this is an application that is meant tho use machine learning order to differentiate different custom made building types in Blender and is for now still work in progress

for this applicatiob I had to:
  create custom models I could use to order them in houseblocks(e.g glassfront skyscrapers, older skyscrapers usw.)|
  order them into appealing houseblocks in order to be able to get  a proper test render to estimate afterwards|
  creating a model than can, with help of examples of these housetypes estimate the current render|
